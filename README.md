On-stream GLSL code created to introduce shaders.

The .klproj files are Kodelife project files, so you will need to download the IDE from here: https://hexler.net. Its a fantastic IDE for developing and experimenting with shaders.

The GLSL files are ready for using ShaderToy (https://shadertoy.com). They can also be embedded into webpages using the example files to be found in the `/shadertoy` or `/shadertoy 2` directories: `index.html` and `webgl-driver.js`.

### YouTube

The videos of the live-stream Shader episodes are archived on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFFtfkaWjMb9UMDpPVnC1Sg). Please subscribe to my YouTube channel to get notified when new videoes are uploaded. Subscribing is free and it helps me out a lot.

### Files in this Repository

- **codebasealpha1.klproj**: a basic 2D shader that clearly shows the distance field (see Epidode 61)
- **codebasealpha2.klproj**: a 2D kaleidoscopic shader, with added hypnotic effect! (see Epidode 61)
- **codebasealpha3.klproj**: soft-colliding spheres - a basic 3D shader (see Epidode 63)
- **codebasealpha4.klproj**: a highly reflective 3D shader! (see Epidode 64)
- **codebasealpha5.klproj**: another 3D shader featuring a shiny cube-like object.
- **codebasealpha6.klproj**: version 1 of our fantastic mountain terrain shader, featuring mountains, snow, forests and fog (see Episodes 65 and 67)
- **codebasealpha7.klproj**: sun, sea and sky (experiental shader where we work on waves and clouds)
- **codebasealpha8.klproj**: clouds, clouds and clouds!
- **codebasealpha9.klproj**: version 2 of the mountain terrain shader - with lakes and clouds added, looks great I think (see Episode 69)
- **codebasealpha10.klproj**: creating a shader for use on-stream; beginning with making fire and smoke, we build a rocket-powered Alf emote that flies up the screen (see Episode 73)
- **codebasealpha11.klproj**: text-based shader project (see Episode 75)
- **TerrainShaderToy.glsl**: version 1 of our terrain shader, built for use in ShaderToy.com
- **TerrainCloudsWaterShaderToy.glsl**: version 2 of our terrain shader, built for use in ShaderToy.com. This version has lakes and clouds.
- **codebasealpha12.klproj**: a truly electrifying 2D shader! (see Episode 80)

Most of the shaders above are also to be found on ShaderToy, under my username, which is of course, `codebasealpha`.

During Episode 75, I set up a static Github.io website to host some of the shaders developed for my stream. This repository can be found here: https://github.com/essenbee/essenbee.github.io
