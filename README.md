# shaders
On-stream GLSL code created to introduce shaders.

The .klproj files are Kodelife project files, so you will need to download the IDE from here: https://hexler.net. Its a fantastic IDE for developing and experimenting with shaders.

The GLSL files are ready for using ShaderToy (https://shadertoy.com). They can also be embedded into webpages using the example files to be found in the `/shadertoy` or `/shadertoy 2` directories: `index.html` and `webgl-driver.js`.

- **codebasealpha1.klproj**: a basic 2D shader that clearly shows the distance field
- **codebasealpha2.klproj**: a 2D kaleidoscopic shader, with added hypnotic effect!
- **codebasealpha3.klproj**: soft-colliding spheres - a basic 3D shader
- **codebasealpha4.klproj**: a highly reflective 3D shader!
- **codebasealpha5.klproj**: another 3D shader featuring a shiny cube-like object.
- **codebasealpha6.klprojv: version 1 of our fantastic mountain terrain shader, featuring mountains, snow, forests and fog
- **codebasealpha7.klproj**: sun, sea and sky (experiental shader where we work on waves and clouds)
- **codebasealpha8.klproj**: clouds, clouds and clouds!
- **codebasealpha9.klproj**: version 2 of the mountain terrain shader - with lakes and clouds added, looks great I think
- **TerrainShaderToy.glsl**: version 1 of our terrain shader, built for use in ShaderToy.com
- **TerrainCloudsWaterShaderToy.glsl**: version 2 of our terrain shader, built for use in ShaderToy.com. This version has lakes and clouds.
